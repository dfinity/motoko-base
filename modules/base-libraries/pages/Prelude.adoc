[[module.Prelude]]
= Prelude

 This prelude file proposes standard library features that _may_
 belong in the _language_ (compiler-internal) prelude sometime, after
 some further experience and discussion.  Until then, they live here.

[[nyi]]
== nyi

[source.no-repl,motoko,subs=+macros]
----
func nyi() : None
----

:::warning
Not yet implemented
:::

 Mark incomplete code with the `nyi` and `xxx` functions.

 Each have calls that are well-typed in all typing contexts, which
 trap in all execution contexts.

[[xxx]]
== xxx

[source.no-repl,motoko,subs=+macros]
----
func xxx() : None
----



[[unreachable]]
== unreachable

[source.no-repl,motoko,subs=+macros]
----
func unreachable() : None
----

 Mark unreachable code with the `unreachable` function.

 Calls are well-typed in all typing contexts, and they
 trap in all execution contexts.
