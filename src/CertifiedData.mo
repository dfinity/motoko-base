/// Certified data.

/// update method processing so that during query call processing, the canister can obtain
/// a certificate about that data.

/// This module provides a _low-level_ interface to this API, aimed at advanced
/// users and library implementors. See the Internet Computer Functional
/// Specification and corresponding documentation for how to use this to make query
/// calls to your canister tamperproof.
