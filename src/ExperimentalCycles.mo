/// Managing cycles within actors on the Internet Computer (IC).
///
/// The usage of the Internet Computer is measured, and paid for, in _cycles_.
/// This library provides imperative operations for observing cycles, transferring cycles, and
/// observing refunds of cycles.
///
/// **WARNING:** This low-level API is **experimental** and likely to change or even disappear.
/// Dedicated syntactic support for manipulating cycles may be added to the language in future, obsoleting this library.
///
/// **NOTE:** Since cycles measure computational resources, the value of  `balance()` can change from one call to the next.
///
/// Example for use on IC:
/// ```motoko no-repl
/// import Cycles "mo:base/ExperimentalCycles";
/// import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
///
/// actor {
///   public func main() : async() {
///     Debug.print("Main balance: " # debug_show(Cycles.balance()));
///     Cycles.add(15_000_000);
///     await operation(); // accepts 10_000_000 cycles
///     Debug.print("Main refunded: " # debug_show(Cycles.refunded())); // 5_000_000
///     Debug.print("Main balance: " # debug_show(Cycles.balance())); // decreased by around 10_000_000
///   };
///
///   func operation() : async() {
///     Debug.print("Operation balance: " # debug_show(Cycles.balance()));
///     Debug.print("Operation available: " # debug_show(Cycles.available()));
///     let obtained = Cycles.accept(10_000_000);
///     Debug.print("Operation obtained: " # debug_show(obtained)); // => 10_000_000
///     Debug.print("Operation balance: " # debug_show(Cycles.balance())); // increased by 10_000_000
///     Debug.print("Operation available: " # debug_show(Cycles.available())); // decreased by 10_000_000
///   }
