/// Timers for one-off or periodic tasks. Applicable as part of the default mechanism.
///
/// Note: If `moc` is invoked with `-no-timer`, the importing will fail.
///
/// Note: The resolution of the timers is in the order of the block rate,
///       so durations should be chosen well above that. For frequent
///       canister wake-ups the heartbeat mechanism should be considered.
///
/// Note: The functionality described below is enabled only when the actor does not override it by declaring an explicit `system func timer`.
///
/// Note: Timers are _not_ persisted across upgrades. One possible strategy
///       to re-establish timers after an upgrade is to walk stable variables
///       in the `post_upgrade` hook and distill necessary timer information
///       from there.
///
/// Note: Basing security (e.g. access control) on timers is almost always
///       the wrong choice. Be sure to inform yourself about state-of-the art
///       dApp security. If you _must use_ timers for security controls, be sure
///       to consider reentrancy issues, and the vanishing of timers on upgrades
///       and reinstalls.
///
/// Note: For further usage information for timers on the IC please consult
///       https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/periodic-tasks#timers-library-limitations
