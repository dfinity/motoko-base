/// Timers for one-off or periodic tasks. Applicable as part of the default mechanism.
/// 
/// :::note [Timer resolution]
/// 
/// The resolution of the timers is in the order of the block rate,
/// so durations should be chosen well above that. For frequent
/// canister wake-ups the heartbeat mechanism should be considered.
/// :::
/// 
/// :::note [Overriding system function]
/// 
/// The functionality described below is enabled only when the actor does not override it by declaring an explicit `system func timer`.
/// :::
/// 
/// :::note [Upgrade persistence]
/// 
/// Timers are _not_ persisted across upgrades. One possible strategy
/// to re-establish timers after an upgrade is to walk stable variables
/// in the `post_upgrade` hook and distill necessary timer information
/// from there.
/// :::
/// 
/// :::note [Security warning]
/// 
/// Basing security (e.g. access control) on timers is almost always the wrong choice.
/// Be sure to inform yourself about state-of-the-art dApp security.
/// If you _must use_ timers for security controls, be sure to consider reentrancy issues,
/// and the vanishing of timers on upgrades and reinstalls.
